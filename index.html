                    The name was founded by the British Railway Engineers sometimes in A.D. 1890-91.

                    This region was a part of ancient Kampitha, Pagarjotic, Pragjyotisha, Kamarupa, Kangoor, Rumi, Vaisali etc. 
                    Nalbari is a district name today.The history of Nalbari is connected with king Jarashandha and Lord Krisna such as Haribhanga.
                    Nalbari region was under the Ashuras, Danavas, Varmanas, Salastambhas, Palas, Bhuyans, Koch, Tai-Ahoms, Mughals etc.
